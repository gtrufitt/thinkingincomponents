    <h1>Thinking in components</h1>
    <h2 id="what-is-thinking-in-components-">What is &#39;Thinking in components&#39;?</h2>
<h3 id="a-componentised-architecture-of-contextless-front-end-elements-">A componentised architecture of contextless front-end elements.</h3>
<p>Developing in a modular fashion is engrained in most back-end development styles and, with the rise of MV* JS, become far more popular when writing JavaScript. Some of the ideas can be translated to mark-up and css. Thinking in components helps front-end developers build consistent, high-quality and maintainable websites but for the process to be smooth, there needs to be buy in from UX, Creative, Client and Business. This website looks to document the tools to help build componentised architectures, and tips on how to gain the support of all parties and stakeholders.</p>

        <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>There are a number of deliverables that help enable us to think about how we develop our front-end architecture - These range from style tiles to pattern libraries. </p>
 
            <h2 id="wireframe-components">Wireframe Components</h2>
<p>By focussing on components in the wireframing and conception stage of a site build, UXers can help to shape the complex nature of pages into more focussed pieces of functionality enabling more discussion around individual element functionality as well as how an entire page fits together.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can use component-based techniques to break complex problems (a page or even an entire site design) into parts that are easier to conceive, understand, and communicate. <a href="http://unify.eightshapes.com/what-you-get/wireframe-components/">Wireframe Components</a></p>

            <h2 id="style-tiles-element-collages">Style Tiles &amp; Element Collages</h2>
<p>Style Tiles and Element Collages are tools to enable the abstract design of websites, out of context of pages. The idea for both style tiles and element collages, is creating conversations about the design direction and focus. It matches with our &#39;thinking in components&#39; philosophy in that the abstract nature of Style Tiles and Element Collages helps our designer friends to portray their ideas out of context of full comps - in the same way that we want to build our front-end components out of context of their pages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[An element collage] isnâ€™t a final design but rather an assembly of disparate pieces without specific logic or order.</p>

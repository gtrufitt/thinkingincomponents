## Style Tiles & Element Collages

Style Tiles and Element Collages are tools to enable the abstract design of websites, out of context of pages. The idea for both style tiles and element collages, is creating conversations about the design direction and focus. It matches with our 'thinking in components' philosophy in that the abstract nature of Style Tiles and Element Collages helps our designer friends to portray their ideas out of context of full comps - in the same way that we want to build our front-end components out of context of their pages.

> [An element collage] isnâ€™t a final design but rather an assembly of disparate pieces without specific logic or order.

## Why?

### Quality
Every element designed, no guessing. Solid foundations - Responsive, semantic and accessible components. Thinking in components enables more discussion around individual functionality and design directions without getting bogged down by the rest of the page.

### Maintainability
Context-free modules mean they can be dropped in anywhere without breaking and further implementation requires minimum or no extra development. Easy to do regression testing when you can see how a component and its modifications behaves in one location.

> By breaking down a design into components, you increase the likelihood that you can reuse individual pieces again in other places with slight or no modification. [Wireframe Components](http://unify.eightshapes.com/what-you-get/wireframe-components/)

### Consistency
Ensure that there is a consistent design and coding style across the website. Communication between clients, UX, designers and developers is increased therefore creating a consistence direction, style and functionality base that works for users and meets client requirements.
